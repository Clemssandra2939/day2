# Number manipulation

# print(int(8/3))
# # to round a float or decimal number to a whole number or an integer
# print(round(8/3))
# # to round to a decimal places like two decimals or three decimal places
# print(round(8/3,2))
# to straight up convert to interger without having to do print(type()) do this when it comes to float when u check the type instead of float it will give an intger
# print(type(8//3))
# it is called the floor division
# when you want to continue a calculation or contine performing a calculations in this variable
# eg if this result is saved in a variable


# result=(4/2)
# result/=2
# print(result)
# # this /= can go with - + / * 


# **********F strings(it is useresult=(4/2)
# result/=2
# print(result)
# # this /= can go with - + / * 



# *******F strings(used to mix strings and different data types)
# in this situation where they is alot to converse and to do it in a single way where there is alot of data types
# score= 0
# height=1.8
# isWinning=True
# # u use (f""),
# print(f"your score is {score},your height is {height} ,you are winning is{isWinning}")



# last coding challenge_for day 2-ur life in weeks
# create a program using maths and f strings that tel us how many days,weeks,months we hv left if we live until 90years



# current_age=input("what is ur current age?")
# target_age=input("what is ur target age?")

# days_remaining=(int(target_age)-int(current_age))*365

# weeks_remaining =(int(target_age)-int(current_age))*52

# months_remaining=(int(target_age)-int(current_age))*12

# print(f"you have {days_remaining}days,{weeks_remaining}weeks,{months_remaining}months left")


# Tip calculator program
print("Welcome to the tip calculator")
total_bill=(input("what is the total_bill? $"))
print(total_bill)
percentage_tip=(input("what is the percentage_tip would u like to give? 10,12 or 15 "))
print(percentage_tip)
num_people=(input("how many people to split the bills?"))
print(num_people)
percentage_number=(int(percentage_tip)/100)
print(percentage_number)
Everyones_bill =int(total_bill) * float(percentage_number)
result=int(Everyones_bill)+ int(total_bill)
print(result)
result/=int(num_people)
print(result)
print(f"Each person should pay:{result}$")
# if the bill was 150.00,split btw 7 people,with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay(150.00/5)*0.12
# Round up to two decimal places
